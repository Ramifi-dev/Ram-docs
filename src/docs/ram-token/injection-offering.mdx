### What is an Injection Offering? (IO)

_Stablecoins are a new type of cryptocurrency that often have their value pegged to another asset._

An injection offering is a new and innovative way to provide investors and the crypto-community with a more sensible approach to Token Offerings. The process of Ramifi’s (RAM) Injection Offering begins with our Market Maker introducing a 50/50 split of Ethereum and RAM token of equal value into a Uniswap V2 contract. This allows 1 RAM Token to be priced at 1 dollar, our initial offering price.

As tokens are purchased with ETH, the amounts in the Market Maker contract will be readjusted on a 24 hour basis. This means that when the contract reaches its first 24 hour cycle, more RAM Token is ‘injected’ or sent into the contract to rebalance the value for each token. Overtime, these cycles will eventually allow a natural distribution to desiring holders until all tokens have been sold.

Additionally, investors will be able to participate and generate daily compounded interest from the offering by adding tokens purchased or airdropped to the Uniswap Liquidity Pool. Uniswap’s protocol allows for simple and easy participation in both the Injection Offering and the Liquidity Pool.

### How will I be able to add liquidity to the offering?

_As the name suggests, stablecoins are designed to have a consistent price or value over time._

Uniswap V2 users will be able to participate and generate daily compounded interest from the offering. Users can do this by adding purchased tokens from the offering with a 1:1 ETH pair to the Ramifi Uniswap Liquidity Pool Contract. Uniswap’s protocol allows for simple and easy participation in both the Injection Offering and the Liquidity Pool.

### Why are you using an IO?

Ramifi created the injection offering to allow market forces to determine and drive how money will be raised for the protocol. We consider this to be a more fluid and dynamic structure which allows investors to participate and profit from an additional offering.
