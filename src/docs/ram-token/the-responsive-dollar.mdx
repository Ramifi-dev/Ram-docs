1 RAM is equal to 1 USD based on a 2020 USDs purchasing power. We accomplish this by looking at what 1 USD can purchase today in terms of major commodities across the globe and averaging them all together weighted by volume.

**Lets take a look at corn which is denominated in bushels.**

> 1Bushel=115.21USD
>
> 1RAM=1/115.21=0.008679Bushels(pC1)

**This is then averaged against other commodities weighted by its global trade volume. So lets add another commodity gold which is denominated in troy ounces and goes for $1,951.50/troy ounce.**

> 1RAM=1/1951.50=0.000512426toz(pG1)

**Now if the price of corn went up 2% and the price of gold went up 5% the new RAM value would be an average of the two weighted by their daily volume.**

Corn's new price would be

> 1/117.5142 = 0.008509(pC2)
> with a daily volume of
> 439,357(vC) @ 117.5142/bushel (pC2)

_If we stopped here 1 RAM would now equal 1.02 USD because (0.008679/0.008509 = 1.02) We aren't basing this on a single commodity however._

Golds new price would be

> 1/2049.075 = 0.00049 (pG2)
> with a daily volume of
> 234,363 (vG) @ 2049.075/t oz (pG2)

> ((pC1/pC2)∗(vC∗pC2)+(pG1/pG2)∗(vG∗pG2))/((vC∗pC2)+(vG∗pG2))

**This equation gives us RAMs new USD value being 1.0471**
